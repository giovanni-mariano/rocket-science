Real precision
--------------
The `double precision` specifier guarantees only a minimum decimal precision and
does not guarantee a precision twice that of a default real entity:

"The decimal precision of double precision real shall be at least 10, and its decimal exponent range shall be at least 37. It is recommended that the decimal precision of default real be at least 6, and that its decimal exponent range be at least 37." (Fortran 2018 standard, p. 59, sec. 7.4.3.2)
